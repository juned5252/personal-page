       <p> <span style="font-size:20px">Hello world</span>, my name is Juned Alam, and I am a 22-year-old striving software developer. I'm a proud New Yorker, although I was born in Bangladesh. I am a current college student enrolled at the prestigious Queens College, where I am pursuing a bachelor in computer science. I consider myself a tech enthusiast and enjoy all things hardware and software related. My interest in becoming a software developer stemmed from the realization that I am almost always on my phone or computer. From these encounters I started to notice the beauty and careful design of the apps and programs that I use almost every day, that made them so appealing to the eyes. they were in a way an art form. Although I like to dabble with as many languages as possible, the languages that I am most familiar with are Java, C++, HTML, CSS, JQuery…. and even a little bit of Spanish.  I am an adept worker who likes to give his absolute one hundred percent to the topic at hand, and my goal is to learn the tricks of the trade and make my own mark by being the best software developer that I can be. Wish me luck on my tech journey and don’t hesitate to contact me about any opportunities.  </p>

                <p>Cyber security seems to be a hot issue these days with all the recent news about online hackings and whatnots. However, todays functioning society revolves around the online infrastructure that is the world wide web. Just like in any society there are peeking eyes everywhere, infringing on your right to privacy. You might have heard of many solutions to this dilemma, from installing peer block or buying the latest round of virus protection service, but the truth is that these softwares that you are relying on to keep you safe are almost a joke to any professional cyber-criminal.  </p>
                <p>With that in mind you might have heard of the Term VPN, but never realized what or how it works or what a crucial role it plays in keeping you anonymous. Starting off with the what, VPN stands for Virtual Private Network, and put simply is a connection of multiple computers (a network) that work together to scatter your connection through various servers in foreign countries around the world. Once a trusted connection is established with the foreign server your connection is secure. Essentially your computer is hiding your ip address and using the address of the server abroad.</p>
                <p>In addition, most paid and top rated VPNs (I recommend PIA VPN) have encryption options as well. Users can choose between a blend of encryption settings, ranging all the way up to 256-bit encryption, although that might severely lower your download and upload speeds. Another feature of established VPNs is what is known as a kill switch. Essentially a kill switch is a protocol built into some VPNs that disables your internet if the ip address provided by the VPN ever fails. This ensures that your real ip address is never exposed to anyone wanting to find out who you are.</p>
                <p>There are many reasons why you would want a VPN besides the obvious. You could be a student or a worker who wants to access work related documents away from the office or campus and needs a secure connection. If you are in a country where human rights are limited and activities on the web are monitored or restricted, a VPN can be useful or even necessary. One of the most widely used application of VPNs are by torrenters that want to hide their ip when downloading illegal content like movies in order to avoid hefty fines. Whatever reason you might have for being anonymous on the internet, a VPN is the only surefire way to stay safe.</p>
